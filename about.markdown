I've built a career working in high-growth tech startups, series A to C (ish) and headcounts 30-300 (ish) - from [GoCardless](https://www.codefirstgirls.org.uk/blog/the-long-awaited-hyc-gocardless-blogpost) to [Monzo](https://monzo.com/blog/2017/03/09/diversity-and-inclusion), then [Snyk](https://snyk.io/blog/my-first-week-at-snyk-was-at-our-all-hands-conference/) and now [Permutive](https://permutive.com/careers/). My focus is on developing human-first structures & processes to make work an enjoyable place to be, and as fulfilling as possible - and growing teams quickly, healthily and deliberately!

I have a theory that most people quit their jobs either _because_ of HR failings, or for reasons that modern people practices could mitigate (e.g. having an ill-equipped or unqualified manager). My personal mission is to take a human-centric approach to people practices, and build cultures where people can do their best work and grow.

I started writing in summer 2019 when I deliberately gave myself a month out between jobs, and then found myself looking for productive and fun things to do with that time. Which is why this blog exists, and why it's built with [jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) despite my better judgement.

My big passions are culture, diversity & inclusion, hiring well, feedback, and finding fun.

# talks & panels

I really enjoy public speaking, both giving talks and taking part in panels or Q&As. I have been described as "lively" and "quite direct", both as positives!
