I've built a career working in high-growth tech startups, developing people processes & frameworks and building culture. I was recognised as one of the [top 25 women leaders in fintech in 2022](https://blog.griffin.sh/2022/02/22/top-women-leaders-fintech-maria-campbell/). I was the first people leader at [GoCardless](https://gocardless.com), [Monzo](https://monzo.com/blog/2017/03/09/diversity-and-inclusion), [Snyk](https://snyk.io/) and [Permutive](https://permutive.com/). 

I'm currently VP People at [Griffin](http://griffin.sh/jobs). You can read more about my journey [here](https://suzansfieldnotes.substack.com/p/leading-a-fintech-startup-pre-launch)! My focus is on developing human-first structures that make work an enjoyable place to be, and as fulfilling as possible - and growing teams quickly, healthily and deliberately!

I have a theory that most people quit their jobs either _because_ of HR failings, or for reasons that modern people practices could mitigate (e.g. having an ill-equipped or unqualified manager). The role of a people team is to centre people's experience of work, and design each of these experiences to be positive and useful for both the business and the individual. Through this, we can build successful businesses and develop highly talented, engaged individuals.

My big passions are culture, inclusive leadership, hiring well, feedback, and finding fun.
