Award-winning leader building high-impact mission-driven companies, from Series A to unicorn.

I've built a career scaling high growth tech and fintech companies in the UK, first as a People & Culture leader and then as Chief Operating Officer. I played a key role as an early employee at tech unicorns such as GoCardless, Monzo, and Snyk. My career sweet spot is helping companies establish the right cultural and operational environment to scale successfully and deliver meaningful value to both customers and employees.
