I’ve spent a lot of time interviewing - approaching 1000 hours, if not more! I’ve been interviewing regularly as part of my job for almost 5 years, and regularly spend 3-10 hours interviewing in any given week. I regularly shadow and coach interviewers. I design interview kits & question banks.

One thing that varies wildly across the 1000+ candidates I've interviewed is what questions they ask when given time at the end of the session.

Asking good questions shows curiosity & engagement, and it's hard (as an interviewer) to determine how significant or relevant it is when a candidate has good questions or no questions. I also find that the types of questions a candidate asks says a lot about what they care about.

When coaching interviewers, I've settled on a few tactics to ensure that the candidate feels able to ask whatever they like. I know some interviewers make this intimidating, and "do you have any questions?" is one of the _least_ inviting ways to ask this, especially to a nervous candidate.

I like to ask:
* What do you want to know about (company)?
* What worries you about us, as a team or business or place to spend the next few years of your career?
* Is there anything you'd like to know that hasn't been covered yet?

I've pulled together an interview question bank specifically for candidates - the questions you should consider asking every interviewer you meet when changing role.

Some of these are the inverse of what I ask candidates for management roles; some I’ve been asked and borrowed(!); some are questions I have used myself in “networking” contexts.

# A quick note on research

Please don't ask questions that you can look up online! I'd recommend looking at LinkedIn (the /people page in the company listing is super useful); Crunchbase; DueDil; AngelList; and of course the company blog & about page.

Work out who's interviewing you, look them up on LinkedIn to see if there's anything particularly pertinent in their background that you'd like to ask about (e.g. maybe they changed teams while at the company). Slice up your questions so you can focus on asking the most relevant interviewer and therefore getting the most useful answers.

And finally, now you have a ton of things to ask, remember you've probably only got 10 mins with each interviewer to find this stuff out - prioritise the things that matter most to you, not just the questions that make you think you sound smart.
