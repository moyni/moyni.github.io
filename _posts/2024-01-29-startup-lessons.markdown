description: "Sometimes contradictory learnings from spending 11 years in startups"

---

I’ve officially been working in startups for eleven years:
* five companies
* four job titles
* three unicorns (and counting..!)
* two banking licences
* one promotion
…thirteen office moves, thousands of one-to-ones, hundreds of interviews, ten offsites, millions in investment, dozens of board meetings, and hundreds of hours googling where to begin with seemingly impossible tasks.

Here are eleven lessons I’ve learnt over that time, which I’m sharing so that you don’t (necessarily!) have to learn them the hard way:
1. Hiring is the most highly leveraged use of your time.
2. Revisit how you communicate. Frequently.
3. Every exec should have a coach and a therapist.
4. Sometimes firing someone is the kindest thing you can do.
5. You are trying to do too much.
6. Office moves are zero fun.
7. You are responsible for yourself.
8. Take your vacation.
9. “Someone should” = volunteering yourself.
10. It’s ok to not know the answer.
11. My parents will never stop asking me when I’m going to get a real job.

I know that some contradict each other, but that’s why they’ve been so fun and valuable to learn! Looking forward to many more over the coming years too – I fervently believe that startups are the best way to keep your learning curve steep.

# 1. Hiring is the most highly leveraged use of your time.

Hiring is a time-suck: you will never have time to write a job description, or interview a dozen candidates, or spend two weeks onboarding someone.

But the best way to make time is to do it anyway.

Every new hire will free up some of your time, by taking on work that otherwise you’d be doing. And they’ll level up both you and your team by bringing new skills, a new perspective and a different set of experiences.

At Monzo, I made the mistake of not hiring a dedicated recruitment person till I was spending about 60% of my time supporting other teams in their hiring. By that point, I absolutely didn’t have time to hire someone in to take over - I was swamped, and I could barely keep on top of the “mission critical” hires I was supporting on. 

Once we brought someone in, it took less than a week for me to see a positive return on the time I spent in that hiring / onboarding / training process. By the end of month one, I was spending less than 15% of my time on hiring - and most of that was on either managing our dedicated hiring specialist or training new interviewers. And she was much better at the job than I had been, of course.

Whenever there’s a hire you need in your team, that needs to be priority #1 until the contract is signed.

# 2. Revisit how you communicate. Frequently.

As a company grows and changes, so too do the ways that you need to communicate. This happens more often than seems reasonable, so proactively considering how you share information is critical to making sure that you’re heard. And you need to be heard, because you have something important to say.

Culture shifts, too, which means that the ways in which a company’s values - including the ones about transparency and collaboration - will manifest differently through communication over time.

When I joined Snyk, there were about 25 of us in the company - mostly software engineers and security specialists, mostly across a 2-hour timezone span. This meant a reasonably manageable number of Slack channels. So I could post something important in #general and reasonably assume that everyone had read it by the next working day. 

By the time I left, we were about 150 people - across Europe, Israel, North America and even Australia - with a fairly even split between commercial, operational and technical roles. The folks in customer-facing roles were mostly external-facing - they spent a huge proportion of their time in calls and meetings, so would read an email within an hour but wouldn’t necessarily check Slack for days; the engineers were almost entirely internal-facing so broadly ignored their emails for days but would emoji-react to a Slack announcement next time they took a break; there was such a wealth of information shared that it was unreasonable to expect or even hope that anyone would retain something they saw in passing. So important news had to go in a whole-company email, a slack message, a follow-up slack message with a fun meme, a follow-up email, a page in our internal wiki, a message to managers to tell their team about it, and at least two all-hands meetings. Then I could assume that most people would talk to someone who knew it sometime in the next week.

Every time your org changes shape, composition, or gets more than about 30% bigger, it’s time to revisit what comms channels matter most to ensuring the right people get the info they need to thrive. 

# 3. Every exec should have a coach and a therapist.

Being a leader is draining, difficult, lonely, and a lot of pressure. Power dynamics make it hard for your team to support you. Your whole leadership team is facing the same, and they don’t have the emotional energy to manage their emotions and yours.

When I was interviewing with Griffin, the CEO asked me what I looked for in a manager. I told him that my manager should have a therapist and a coach. I have no qualms about declaring this in interviews anymore - I know what kind of support I am happy to provide, and what’s out of scope.

The execs, and particularly the founders, that I’ve worked with who have a therapist are a lot more enjoyable to work with than those who don’t. I also think everyone should have a therapist! Especially in a difficult, lonely role with a huge amount of pressure and stress. But I’ve found it’s really hard for me to do a difficult role in hugely ambiguous circumstances if my peers haven’t got someone else to take care of their inner life.

# 4. Sometimes firing someone is the kindest thing to do.

Nobody is fundamentally bad or unemployable. Sometimes there is a role-person mismatch, or a company-person mismatch.

I’ve hired people that I worked with at a previous startup where they were fired, and given supportive personal references for people I’ve fired when they’re looking at new companies. Two of my closest friends are former startup coworkers that we fired. It’s about context, and kindness.

When someone’s not performing, or behaving unacceptably, it has an impact on their work, their team, their manager, and every person they interact with. Tolerating poor performance indefinitely signals to those who are working hard that they could just not. It creates a sense of unfairness, and ultimately high performers leave (known as the [Dead Sea Effect](http://brucefwebster.com/2008/04/11/the-wetware-crisis-the-dead-sea-effect/)).

In a small company moving at pace, the impact is amplified. The system-level impact of one poor performer, or one individual whose conduct has a negative impact on others, is that much higher. Where someone could’ve been an average employee at another company, average isn’t tenable - there’s not enough other people in any given function to dilute the impact. The other piece that’s unique to startups is that everyone’s role changes and grows almost continually, and often bringing someone up to where they _need_ to be performing ends up being a perpetual catch-up process.

In a lot of cases, firing the person is the kindest thing to do for the individual and for the system. Providing you give them useful feedback, a financial safety net, and as much post-employment support as you can.

# 5. You are trying to do too much.

We like things that come in threes. In every company-level goal-setting exercise I’ve led, there’s been an urge to set three big goals for the year. But this just splits focus. Ruthlessly prioritising _one thing only_ gives a degree of clarity that we really need so that we can actually achieve something.

This is particularly true in small companies, where setting three big goals ends up meaning that every person in the entire org has to juggle three competing priorities, and you achieve none of them.

In the earliest days of Monzo, we were super focussed and knew the priority. User growth was critical: if that meant dropping everything to seal envelopes and affix stamps, that’s what we all did. But as the company grew, we slipped into setting too many goals and losing focus. The thing that rescued us, there, was that our founder-CEO took fast, decisive action to course correct: unit economics was our focus. He reinforced this at every weekly all-hands meeting, to the extent that “unit economics” became both a rallying cry and a meme. And the needle moved _fast_ once we’d reset. 

When I joined Permutive, every team had a different set of (too many) goals, and we weren’t making a ton of progress on them all. We reset, leaning into ruthlessly deprioritising things that weren’t critical, and ending with fewer, clearer goals. At Griffin, our three big goals for 2022 included “life” – to keep in our minds that achieving the first two required us not burning out, making time for [talking to each other](https://lowercaseopinions.com/chatter) and [strengthening our community](https://lowercaseopinions.com/teambuilding).

I know that you often need to achieve more than one goal, and this is where roadmaps can be really helpful. Setting one goal for a quarter creates focus, and flagging potential future goals for other quarters acknowledges the things you’re _not_ working on yet. There’s something really liberating about the roadmap as a tool for saying “not now” to requests. Once you can defer work and acknowledge that it’s noted, but deferred, it’s much easier to have a guilt-free no.

# 6. Office moves are zero fun.

You need to know how much your headcount is going to grow over the next 12+ months, find a short lease, plan fitout, negotiate costs, do legal back and forth, someone needs to go and find physical copies of various documents, you need investor signoff, you need movers booked, desks have to be built, something goes wrong, someone doesn’t like the location, the wifi isn’t good enough, that one tap doesn’t work, you’ve raised more money than you were expecting so are going to outgrow the office before the lease is up, a pandemic hits so you never get to actually enjoy the space, and everyone is low-key upset because of [Change](https://larahogan.me/blog/desk-moves/).

I’ve been involved in ten - from single-handedly doing the whole thing, to providing guidance and support for the person organising it. This is partly why I like remote-first organisations! Reducing the stress by leaning into default-distributed, using tools like Desana, or opting for managed space: these are all money well-spent.

# 7. You are responsible for yourself.

You have to take responsibility for your career, your wellbeing, your workload, and your achievements and failures. This means finding a level of zen, and accepting that nobody will get you what you need. People can help, but you need to first understand what it is that you want and need. If you don’t know, you can’t ask, and you can’t expect others to work it out for you.

At GoCardless, I hired an office manager who was really talented but discovered several months in that office management wasn’t what she really wanted to do. She asked me what her career options were. Now, startups are not a career-progression conveyor-belt: it’s not like consultancy, where performing well for a certain period of time means a promotion to the next level, and it’s not a static business where you can get your boss’s job if you just wait for her to retire. That year, we were planning to make 30+ hires across the company - there were plenty of opportunities to move role. But she didn’t know what she wanted, so we couldn’t rejig the work that needed to be done across the company and slice it into a role that would meet her needs.

In other orgs, I’ve seen people transition from customer support to product management, office management to product marketing, finance to people experience, customer success to chief of staff, business operations to financial crime prevention... the options are almost limitless. So you need to decide what you want, [whatever that looks like](https://lowercaseopinions.com/career-plan), and be proactive in finding the opportunities you want.

One thing I’ve found helpful, especially when reporting to a CEO-founder, is building my own [manager voltron](https://larahogan.me/blog/manager-voltron/) so that I have a collective of supporting, challenging voices surrounding me.

# 8. Take your vacation.

Burnout is not fun! It is not a rite of passage to celebrate! Sometimes it happens, and that’s _not_ a failure, but it’s a pretty big consequence. I do not think taking a holiday can prevent burnout! …but I brush my teeth everyday even though I might one day need a wisdom tooth removed.

Your vacation days are your entitlement. You get them the same as you get your salary – it’s part of the deal of working. If you _don’t_ take them, they disappear into the ether, and you don’t benefit. If you _can’t_ take them, that’s an organisational problem – there’s some slack missing in the system, not enough redundancy or resilience in the company.

When I first joined GoCardless, we had an “unlimited holiday” policy. The people who took less than five days in a calendar year were not happier or better than those who took thirty. At Monzo, I introduced a hybrid model where you had a set number of days, but could take more as unpaid holiday if you wanted to – the benefits of unlimited with a hard floor. I remember at Snyk, our Chief Product Officer said you’d built a great team if you could go away for a week and nothing bad happened, an excellent team if you came back after two weeks and they’d missed you but been fine. I strive for a two week uninterrupted vacation as a test for team resilience.

# 9. “Someone should” = volunteering yourself.

By their nature, startups have big aspirations and not quite enough people or time to achieve all of them as quickly as you’d ideally want (see 5. You are trying to do too much). This means that yes, probably someone _should_ do XYZ, but _someone_ is currently doing a series of other things that have taken priority. If you genuinely think someone _should_ do it, and others agree with you, then you are likely going to end up doing it yourself.

At GoCardless, I thought someone should make it easier for non-engineers to make changes to our careers page. This meant I hijacked 30mins of an engineering intern’s time to teach me how to navigate GitHub, our react codebase, a text editor, and terminal. Then I took over that part of our website and it belonged to my team. At Permutive, we thought it might be nice to have an all-company kickoff week – so I organised and ran one. After we’d struggled to find the right head of product, we thought someone should sketch out a basic product management playbook to tide us over; so the CEO’s chief of staff & I did. At Griffin, I stepped in to project-manage our banking licence application (which teed me up really nicely for a big career change into the COO role, in hindsight!)

I’ve accidentally volunteered myself for things that definitely weren’t my job _countless_ times. It’s been a fantastic way to learn. If it’s clear that something needs to happen, picking it up and running with it is often a good shout. Although I’ve mostly stopped saying “someone should”, now – I either do it myself, or identify the right person and clearly task them with taking it on.

# 10. It’s ok to not know the answer.

Regular readers will know how much I value learning and feedback and iteration. Knowing things is so often not your job in a startup. By definition, the high value work in a startup is doing something nobody has done before, and for everything else you can look it up. The important skill is synthesising, executing, understanding – it has not been knowing since we started having almost all of the world’s knowledge a couple of keystrokes away.

I don’t know, but I can find out. And I can look that up.

# 11. My parents will never stop asking me when I’m going to get a real job.

I’ve always joined very early-stage startups, which means that literally nobody has heard of the company when I join. My parents don’t read the tech press, so I send them links to coverage of companies I work at. 

When I got my first startup job, my mum told me she was very proud of me but didn’t understand what I was doing, or where, or why. Once my mum saw GoCardless on her bank statement, she believed it wasn’t entirely fictional (some years after I left). Monzo was mentioned on a BBC news-related programme once, which also helped. Seeing my name associated with Griffin on the FCA register definitely made that feel _somewhat_ real to her. I think they still believe that at some point I’ll join a “proper company”, but until then, I’ll keep sending them links.

More generally, as an early-stage person, I’ve gotten used to this now. It feels like success the first time I mention where I’ve been working and someone has actually heard of the company. Even moreso when folks start putting “ex-Company” in their LinkedIn headline, and I can say to myself “I helped make that”.
