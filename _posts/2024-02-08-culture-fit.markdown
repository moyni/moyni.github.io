A few years ago I was rejected out of an interview process because I was “not a good culture fit”.

My spidey sense was tingling: how much had they really thought about culture? Could they articulate what about me did not fit with their culture? I’m a (relatively young at the time) queer femme, the rest of their leadership team was… not.

Feeling bold - knowing it wouldn’t change the output, but wanting to poke at that bruise - I responded to thank them for their feedback and to ask: could you be more specific? which part of your culture am I not a fit for?

I waited. Wavering between expectations: some deeply personal criticism of me? or a “sorry we can’t give you more feedback” and maybe some introspection on their end?

I thought it would help either way - maybe they can’t tell me because they don’t really have a proper reason, and me asking will prompt them to consider. Maybe they can tell me something about myself and I can reflect on this new knowledge and consider how to move forward.

They did respond, which I was delighted about, and more than a little bit surprised by. They told me: you’re not a good culture fit for us because you’re “not maternal enough”. And like, there’s a lot to unpack here: I am literally someone’s parent.

However they’re correct – I am _super_ not maternal at work, because I work with adults. I’m analytical, strategic and insightful, and those are the parts of me that I love flexing at work.

But the lesson for me, from this, was that I _really_ had expected my question about my lack of “culture fit” to be met with silence, and some deep reflection or introspection among the interviewing team about _why_ they didn’t want to hire me. 

I wanted them to think a little about what culture they were trying to design - as I guess some grand gesture of generosity and self-validation. But once I learnt that they _had_ thought about their culture, and knew why I wasn’t a culture fit, I felt relieved. I am going to leave aside whether I think ‘being sufficiently maternal/paternal’ is a good threshold quality to be looking for in a senior leader for a technology business.

But ultimately, I will _not_ thrive in a culture where I am required to be maternal! I would have failed there. I would not have enjoyed myself. So their decision to not hire me for culture fit reasons saved us all from that.

# What is workplace culture even

I’ve built my career in fintech, which is _really interesting_ from a culture perspective, because we are _expected_ to care very deeply about the culture that we have. There’s an _entire regulatory body_ in the UK that is all about conduct and organisational culture in financial services firms. The FCA put out a [discussion paper on culture](https://www.fca.org.uk/publication/discussion/dp18-02.pdf) a while back, which I got to contribute to.

A lot of what makes a company _work_ is culture. It is your culture that determines whether your company can provide more than money to your people - and that is what determines who you attract and retain. It is your culture that defines what the work experience will be like for every one of the people who choose to come along that company-building journey with you - and that experience is what determines how your people will produce work, which in turn determines what products and services you put into the world and what impact you have.

“Anyone who wishes to keep a swarm of bees on a desirable course is better off tending the flowers in the meadow, not drilling every bee in turn.” This is a quote I adore that really encapsulates culture (it’s from cultural theorist Zygmunt Bauman in his book Culture in a Liquid Modern World)

This culture-tending process is critical, but I think it’s most interesting to think about it right at the start of the journey people take with our companies. Specifically, how we use culture fit as a tool for making decisions on who we hire.

# Culture fit

I don’t love the phrase “culture fit” - it has a lot of [negative connotations](https://lowercaseopinions.com/safe-place) from how it has been misused as a catchall for justifying questionable decisions, hence my spidey-sense reaction at that interview feedback I got.

It is worth digging a little deeper into this uncomfortably overloaded term. So that we can reclaim it as something _useful_, that we can implement in our toolkit, on our journeys to building an incredible, safe, _challenging_ place for effective teams to get important things done.

Where do we hear the term “culture fit”? We mostly hear it at crunch time: hiring decisions, firing decisions.

At its worst, “culture fit” is quoted as the reason to hire our mates who like the same sportsball team as us and do good banter. I think the first story I read about “culture fit” as a concept in startups recommended the ‘airport test’. Where essentially culture fit is “would I want to be stuck in an airport with this person?” I’m a genuine delight to be stuck in the airport with: I have noise cancelling headphones, several books, and I travel with a charging block, so I’ll be no bother at all. Therefore I guess I am objectively a great culture fit?

This is not culture fit at its worst, though, really. At its very worst, “bad culture fit” is what we turn to when we don’t want to be challenged. Maybe that perceived challenge comes from someone who’s different from us - like your first leader who is from a different mould to the rest of them.A while back we hand some press quoting that “Facebook did not hire Black employees because they were not a 'culture fit’”. So how do we move from vague just-a-feeling didn’t-really-vibe-with-her-somehow maybe-discriminating “culture fit” to something actually useful and concrete?

We do that by making a purposeful _space_ for assessing culture fit. Let’s add some rigour! We know culture is tangible. There’s a _regulatory body_ for culture in banks, this is not something vague and spectral. We should be able to describe our culture.

We need to be able to use cultural alignment when we’re hiring, when we’re reviewing performance, when we’re deciding who to promote and who to terminate. So let’s systematise it.

# What should we mean?

At a fundamental level, what we SHOULD actually mean by “culture fit” is whether the person, and the culture we’re creating, are _mutually compatible_. Whether the values and behaviours that we hold are aligned. We should be building this picture of culture fit _intentionally_, and executing deliberately, rather than fumbling our way around what is important by extrapolating to justify our hunches and gut-feel.

This is not about full immersion, merging the person with the company. There are many aspects to a company’s culture which are learnable, and many aspects of a person which are not at all relevant to whether they’ll thrive in your organisation. There are spaces where we can compromise, and spaces where we can train people. But there are also spaces where it is _very hard to compromise_.

What needs to sit in the non-compromise space are two things: the company’s core values; and the person’s ways of working.

As humans we have quite profoundly personal, complex core values. We contain multitudes and depth. Even if we haven’t articulated it.

The company, on the other hand, has a more limited set of values - because they need to be sharable, or shared, by multiple people, and they need to be easily communicated.

The [company’s core values](https://lowercaseopinions.com/useful-values) are a subset that sits somewhere within the deeper set of core values that the person has.

As a communication layer, a filter for what’s important and a lens for decision-making, our company values will naturally be simpler than our personal values. So the question here is really whether the _company’s_ values fit in to the person’s values.

Ways of working is kind of the opposite to values. As humans we’re pretty flexible - we’re social animals, we’ll run with the pack. But our _companies_ are hard to change. and our ways of working - this part of that slow and particular and artificial accretion of habit and circumstance that we call culture - is where we need our people’s ways of working to align enough with the company’s.

An example consider (a) rapid iterative ways of working, vs (b) deliberately honing for long-term perfection. If you hone for long-term perfection, you’ll struggle to be comfortable in a scrappy ship-it-while-you’re-embarrassed environment.

# Culture fit and inclusion

While “culture fit” can be how discrimination gets through unchallenged, a rigorous structured culture fit assessment can pierce these biases. It can bring people from very different backgrounds closer together, and lead to inclusive safe teams.

When we start our relationship from a foundation of shared values, trust is easier. You know what others value. Conflict is simpler because our conflict is not about what we value and care about, but how we work to best fulfil these.

Trust is built on credibility, reliability and vulnerability. Knowing someone shares our values increases that reliability portion. It builds a stronger connection because you know there will be no surprises - there’s increased predictability there, because you know they’ll act in accordance with your shared values. 

Shared, agreed ways of working help in the same way. We know how others should work, we know what cultural behaviours to expect from them. Surprises are almost transgressions - they’re clearcut, easier to identify, and more comfortable to discuss when we’ve already agreed what we expect from one another at work.

The same applies to psychological safety: mutual respect comes more easily because we understand that we all have aligned around a set of values that we each share.

By specifying what we _mean_ by culture fit - what the tangible values and ways of working are that we assess against - we have a concrete framework for getting more granular than “not a culture fit”. This gives us a useful forcing function - a set of criteria - that we can use to explain and understand _why_.

# Making a scorecard

Let’s get practical. How do we get to this concrete set of criteria? We need to introspect.

What are the values that we hold as a company, and need everyone else to hold in order to be successful as part of our team?
What are the ways of working that we explicitly expect others to adopt so that they can thrive in our team?

These are not easy questions to answer. There are a million blog posts out there about [setting your company’s values](https://lowercaseopinions.com/useful-values). But as with all systems, investing the time and energy in resolving these questions will help us to make better decisions.

We really don’t want a ton of these. Just the make-or-break values and working principles that we _really_ evaluate against.

From here, we can *design* a set of questions to capture these. To understand whether someone’s personal values include our company’s values. To find out when someone has been comfortable or successful using the ways of working we hold to.

There’s an interesting tension, here, too, so we need to be adaptable about how we seek that out. Perhaps you’re a lawyer or a compliance professional for whom ‘learn from your mistakes’ is ...not how your discipline works. So we need to be open to looking at the whole person, outside of work. Perhaps they’re into sport or cooking and that gives us a useful space for experimenting and failing.

We can determine the difference between a good answer and a bad answer - ideally through running these questions through those who already exist in our companies and we know are a “good” culture fit.

This concrete framework then becomes a tool we can recycle, reuse, adapt, iterate, finesse, and adjust as our culture changes. We can weave this through more of our people processes. From hiring and firing, to onboarding, to feedback and performance reviews, to promotions and job changes. 

It’s such a powerful concrete appraisal framework that we can bond our teams ever closer by using it at every part of our team’s experience of work. By reinforcing our culture by holding each other accountable to these core cultural elements that we’ve agreed on.

Creating this involves deep introspection, analysis and alignment. But once you’ve made it, it is yours to keep. A new tool for your kit. A rigorous, permanent (but iterable!), artifact that you can carry with you on your company’s journey, to nurture your culture and your teams. That you can use to hold each other to account when you lean on culture-fit as a vague catch-all for decision making.

Culture fit can be concrete, yet quirky. Concrete, yet inclusive and welcoming. We must be concrete about what we mean by culture fit so that we can use it.
