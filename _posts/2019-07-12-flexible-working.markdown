I'm continually baffled by tech companies who set fixed working hours and expect everyone to work from the same place all the time. It feels old fashioned, in an industry that prides itself on innovation. And I've seen the advantages of flexible working play out - in terms of organisational effectiveness, as well as hiring & retention.

Personally, I've worked part-time, I've worked from home 1-3x a week, I've worked fully remote from an apartment in Istanbul, and 

My first tech startup role, which I started just after my child's first birthday, was a four-day week: three days in the office, one day of completely unpredictable hours split across two days' naptimes, evenings and stolen hours at the weekend.

I've worked in companies where there's a designated work-from-home day each week; I've also worked in a globally distributed company with teammates in other timezones with different public holidays.

There are so many advantages to flexible working, both for the individual and the company. I genuinely don't know if there's any role in any business that would be compelling enough for me to sacrifice these freedoms.

# Ability to hire a more diverse team

Parents are the obvious ones here. Childcare is a total nightmare and seems to be predicated on everyone working 9-5 with zero commute. Women with children typically shoulder the brunt of childcare responsibility.

But this spans out to everyone with dependents or caring responsibilities - and in general, people of colour have more dependents than white people.

Flexible working also generally works better for folks with disabilities. Commuting during rush hours with a physical disability? Chronic illnesses often require relatively high amounts of contact time with medical specialists (who work standard business hours..!). And open-plan offices are really not well designed for neurodivergence. 

With an organisational commitment to working flexibly, to accommodating different locations, you also make it easier to hire folks who want to work part-time.

# Better communication
If you can't rely on everyone being present, you need to _plan_ meetings instead of interrupting people's days.

You need to have conversations in writing or wait till _all_ relevant people can attend. This lends itself to less synchronous decision-making, which benefits folks who like to ponder before deciding (vs people who live for snap decisions).

You also build a better organisational memory. The reason why you chose X instead of Y is fairly easy to surface through searching comms tools, rather than hoping to find someone who was involved in the decision (by guessing?) or hoping someone near you now happened to be in earshot when the decision was made.

# Productivity


# Quality of work


# Legal rights too!

We all (in the UK anyway) have the _right_ to formally request flexible working arrangements. There are a short list of reasons why a company can refuse:
* extra costs that will damage the business
* the work cannot be reorganised among other staff (if you're doing _fewer_ hours or your work is time-bound e.g. customer service)
* people cannot be recruited to do the work (again, if you're doing _fewer_ hours)
* flexible working will affect quality and performance
* the business will not be able to meet customer demand
* thereâ€™s a lack of work to do during the proposed working times
* the business is planning changes to the workforce

But that's it. So given that you'll need to acquiesce to most flexible working requests, it's quicker and easier to set up your boundaries and guidelines early, rather than in response to one of these requests. You'll buy goodwill from your team, you'll find it easier to hire, and you'll remove the nerve-wracking tension for those in your team who have a genuine _need_ to work flexibly (vs a very valid preference!).

# OK I'm sold, how do we get there?

I'm aware it can be a little daunting to start making a change like this. It takes a mindset shift as much as a policy change. But it doesn't have to be everything at once, you can ease into it, and it's good practice to set some guardrails and guidelines for comfort and to make the transition smoother.
