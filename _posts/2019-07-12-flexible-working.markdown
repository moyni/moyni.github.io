OK there are two things here:
1. companies that _actually_ expect you to work 9-6 every day in the office.
2. companies that haven't gotten round to articulating their expectations yet so have "9-6 with a one hour lunchbreak" in their contracts but you probably have some flex.

And you know you have the right to formally request flexible working arrangements. There are a short list of reasons why a company can refuse:
* extra costs that will damage the business
* the work cannot be reorganised among other staff (if you're doing _fewer_ hours or your work is time-bound e.g. customer service)
* people cannot be recruited to do the work (again, if you're doing _fewer_ hours)
* flexible working will affect quality and performance
* the business will not be able to meet customer demand
* thereâ€™s a lack of work to do during the proposed working times
* the business is planning changes to the workforce

But that's it. So given that you'll need to acquiesce to most flexible working requests, it's quicker and easier to set up your boundaries and guidelines early, rather than in response to one of these requests. You'll buy goodwill from your team, you'll find it easier to hire, and you'll remove the nerve-wracking tension for those in your team who have a genuine _need_ to work flexibly (vs a very valid preference!).

# How can I be sure you're working?


# What about our customers?


# We can't do all our jobs well from home


# Face-time is important


# Time zones are hard, won't this be the same?
