I'm continually baffled by tech companies who set fixed working hours and expect everyone to work from the same place all the time. It feels old fashioned, in an industry that prides itself on innovation. And I've seen the advantages of flexible working play out - in terms of organisational effectiveness, as well as hiring & retention.

Personally, I've worked part-time, I've worked from home 1-3x a week, I've worked fully remote from an apartment in Istanbul, and I've managed a globally distributed team spanning seven timezones.

My first tech startup role, which I started just after my child's first birthday, was a four-day week: three days in the office, one day of completely unpredictable hours split across two days' naptimes, evenings and stolen hours at the weekend.

I've worked in companies where there's a designated work-from-home day each week; I've also worked in a globally distributed company where every team was distributed across at least two timezones with different public holidays and there were exactly zero hours each week which fell into 'normal business hours' for everyone in the company.

There are so many advantages to flexible working, both for the individual and the company. We talk a lot about the advantages to the individual, and the corollary that happier people means better retention.

Having flexible work patterns requires some organisational changes, all of which end up being advantageous to the overall health of the organisation.

# Ability to hire a more diverse team

We _know_ that a diverse team is a better team, so I'm not going to spend time making the business case or explaining why this is a good thing. Let's talk instead about how flexible working helps you build a more diverse (and therefore better) team.

Parents are the obvious beneficiaries of flexible working. Childcare is expensive and seems to be predicated on everyone working 9-5 with zero commute. Women with children typically shoulder the brunt of childcare responsibility in families, too.

This spans out further to everyone with adult dependents or caring responsibilities, too. In general, people of colour have more dependents than white people, so benefit even further from the flexibility to take a sibling or parent to a medical appointment or other activity.

Flexible working also generally works better for folks with disabilities. Commuting during rush hours with a physical disability? Chronic illnesses often require relatively high amounts of contact time with medical specialists, and your stressed & depressed employees will likely want to see a therapist every week, all of which needs to take place during standard business hours. Open-plan offices are really not well designed for neurodivergence (or arguably neurotypicals, though my feelings about office design are firmly out of scope here).

# Better communication

Flexible working is a forcing function to fix your internal comms rhythms and routines.

One of the "joys" of a fully co-located team with set hours is that you can have meetings whenever you like, and you can always just tap the person you want to talk to on the shoulder.

However this has a lot of downsides, especially once you're communicating at any kind of scale - and even more downsides when you're doubling your company size every 6-9 months.

Ironically, the way to improve your company's internal communication effectiveness means both (1) disregarding the perceived advantages of having everyone all in the same place at the same time and (2) doing the thing that you are annoyed you need to do to accommodate flexibility. Arguably you should do all these things _even if_ your company is fully co-located, but colocation means you can get away with not doing it and living in a broken state for longer.



You need to have conversations in writing or wait till _all_ relevant people can attend. This lends itself to less synchronous decision-making, which benefits folks who like to ponder before deciding (vs people who live for snap decisions).

More asynchronous communication, too: 

Better documentation: 

You also build a better organisational memory. The reason why you chose X instead of Y is fairly easy to surface through searching comms tools, rather than hoping to find someone who was involved in the decision (by guessing?) or hoping someone near you now happened to be in earshot when the decision was made.

# Productivity

If you can't rely on everyone being present, you need to _plan_ meetings instead of having many short ad hoc interrupt conversations.




# Quality of work


# Legal rights too!

We all (in the UK anyway) have the _right_ to formally request flexible working arrangements. There are a short list of reasons why a company can refuse:
* extra costs that will damage the business
* the work cannot be reorganised among other staff (if you're doing _fewer_ hours or your work is time-bound e.g. customer service)
* people cannot be recruited to do the work (again, if you're doing _fewer_ hours)
* flexible working will affect quality and performance
* the business will not be able to meet customer demand
* thereâ€™s a lack of work to do during the proposed working times
* the business is planning changes to the workforce

But that's it. So given that you'll need to acquiesce to most flexible working requests, it's quicker and easier to set up your boundaries and guidelines early, rather than in response to one of these requests. You'll buy goodwill from your team, you'll find it easier to hire, and you'll remove the nerve-wracking tension for those in your team who have a genuine _need_ to work flexibly (vs a very valid preference!).

# OK I'm sold, how do we get there?

I'm aware it can be a little daunting to start making a change like this. It takes a mindset shift as much as a policy change. But it doesn't have to be everything at once, you can ease into it, and it's good practice to set some guardrails and guidelines for comfort and to make the transition smoother.
