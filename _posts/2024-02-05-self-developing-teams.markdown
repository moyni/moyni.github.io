---

I have often sort-of joked that my life goals are to get cooler and smarter. I spend a lot of time thinking ([and](https://lowercaseopinions.com/better-feedback) [sometimes](https://lowercaseopinions.com/connective-learning) [writing](https://lowercaseopinions.com/criticism)) about personal and professional development. Both as part of my job as a leader, and as a curious, ambitious person!

As someone who loves early stage startups, I’ve never joined a company where someone else held the role first: there were no foundations or scaffolding to build on. Like the companies themselves, I was doing something new, starting from scratch, and really able to shape the job (and my teams!) myself.

Every team is a collection of humans that you work with to achieve something. Perhaps it’s a team of your peers; maybe it’s your family, your housemates, your sports team, your orchestra.

We create things together as teams, but we also *create our teams* ourselves. When we think of a team, it’s not just a bunch of people. A roomful of people dining at a restaurant aren’t a team, even though they are all in the same place, doing the same thing. There’s some spirit of togetherness, of identity, of shared experiences and goals, that forges us into teams.

Every one of us has a role to play in this team building process. Even if we don’t have control over what elements go into the team - you have the pieces you’re given - we can still shape and mould how the overall team works and feels and grows.

As with the work we do, building our teams - and forging them into self-developing teams - is a collective pursuit of creativity, discovery, and learning. Thinking about leadership teams particularly: leaders come in a WIDE variety of different flavours. Highly diverse skillsets, radically different professional and educational backgrounds. A leadership team is necessarily a multi-skilled, complementary collective of individual people, which makes them perfect for cross-learning and seeding what each of us excel at.

Nobody gives you a certificate to say “congrats, you’re officially a leader” (much as I would still love one of these). There is no checklist of things you need to learn from books, or an exam you can take. And it’s different in every organisation - the balance of industry knowledge vs deep empathy vs commerciality vs analysis vs strategy vs organisational awareness vs ...everything else. We inhabit a realm where soft, human, real skills are super valuable. 

For me, this is the joyful part: we get to figure it out as we go! To invent new approaches, to understand the best practices that are there and to mindfully adopt or deviate from them, to find the role in the teams that work best for us and the others around us.

And this is the essence of a self-developing leadership team. One where we knit together the strands of what we each know, what we’re strong at, the experience we’ve had. A deliberately self-developing team is one where each individual as a whole person is pulled up to change in positive ways, to learn and grow, to have a bigger impact, to participate more closely in the team community that they’re part of.

We have to keep learning. And because this fundamental curiosity and adaptability is almost required in order to be an effective leader, we need to indulge this and to use it as our superpower. It means finding the lesson in everything, and applying the lessons to become better - more whole, more collaborative, more expert, more impactful.

This might sound like hard work. Why does this matter? Why should we invest thought, energy and time into fostering the spirit of self-development in our leadership teams? Can’t we just hire the most expert person and leave them to it?

I hope that one day, investing time in developing ourselves and those around us becomes much like diversity - where we don’t need a business case because it’s screamingly obvious how NOT leaning into this is failing us, our teams and our businesses.

But in the meantime, there’s evidence. From various papers by [Kegan & Lahey](https://heartofimpact.com/s/the-deliberately-developmental-organization.pdf) that go into the financial performance of companies who adopt a deliberately developmental mindset, to the wealth of products and features that have sprung from innovative collaboration within and across companies, to the hard fact that learning and progression is a core enabler for retaining talented employees. 

Fundamentally, it is about growth and flourishing.

The world is changing at an increasing rate. We haven’t really reimagined the work environment for this future that we live in. While this last few years have forced many to open their eyes to remote work, we’re still pretty close to office life decades ago - before I was born! We still think of the employment contract as an exchange of money for time or mental energy.

But this work - this time and mental energy, this productivity that we exchange with our employer for money - this work is part of our human purpose. Work, as the normal life of every human being; work, in which is joy and growth and service… learning, self-development. And when we grow together, we’re better for it.

We each learn and develop at different rates. We have knacks, skills, aptitudes, experiences. This diversity of skillsets, of viewpoints, of perspectives. We combine these and we can have a team of leaders that is stronger than any individual within it. We embrace our differences and our variety! We’re not building a clone army -- we’re building a multi-faceted high-achieving flourishing team.

With our teams as our learning communities, we can help each other along. We can each learn and grow from each other, and pull each other up with us. We can take that journey together, using a shared map, and explore faster, and find what we need sooner. 

But first, we need to recognise three core axioms:

1. work is meaningful. Much of that meaning comes from impact, community, and learning.
2. humans matter. A business is made of humans. People genuinely are our most important asset.
3. change is natural. People, communities, businesses, processes, customers, markets, industries, societies, the environment we exist in — these all naturally develop.

Without holding these true, I don't think this is going to work for you. If you believe these, then read on for the concrete steps that will foster self-developing teams: goals, safety and rituals.

## Goals

What are we learning? Where are we developing ourselves? What’s our aim? What do we need to be more of?

The first element of building a self-developing team is understanding the goals. Development is directional. It’s never aimless - there’s always a goal to it, and understanding which type of goal applies to both the team and each person within it, well, that’s essential for helping us to focus our efforts. As a leadership team, this often ends up being a corollary of strategy setting. Once you’ve asked what your organisation is uniquely well-equpped to achieve, you can marry up where you want to *go* with where you want to stretch and challenge yourselves along the way.

The ideal end state: shared, visible development goals for the leadership team, as a collective and as individuals. That feels intimidating, though, right? Which brings us on to category two.

## Safety

Can we fail? When we do, can we share our mistakes for others to learn from? Do we trust each other to have our best interests at heart?

By its nature, developing means being aware of weaknesses, and sharing these with those around us. It means exposing our raw edges to each other so that we can learn. And to do that, we need to feel safe. 

Building psychological safety within the team is difficult, necessary, and somewhat out of scope of this particular piece. But it starts with inviting each other in, to build that trust and reciprocity. Demonstrate an interest in feedback from those you work with - in [criticism](https://lowercaseopinions.com/criticism) with the objective of knowing where to learn.

## Rituals

How do we stay focussed on this? What do we need to do to engrain this in our day to day?

Rituals are there to support in this endeavour to make developing yourself and others part of your day to day business, like checking your emails or saying “good morning” in Slack or spellchecking documents before you PDF them to share with others.

Show off! Make lessons-learnt part of your regular cadences, whether that’s exec team meetings or all hands meetings or retros. Schedule a quarterly self-development check-in outside of your formal performance review process (if you have one).

Praise learning - the process, not the results. Work out which processes and habits to reinforce this learning, self-developing loop so that it doesn’t fizzle out.

# It is never too early to start this journey.

All it takes to start this journey is for one person in your team to develop themselves as a result of one other person’s effort. This is the beginning of the journey. Often the only way to get started is by picking the easy thing and just doing it.
