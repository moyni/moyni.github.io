I"„<p>I‚Äôve spent a <em>lot</em> of time interviewing. I‚Äôve been interviewing regularly as part of my job for years, and regularly spend 3-10 hours interviewing in any given week. I shadow and coach interviewers, with a focus on making the time we spend interviewing more useful and enjoyable for all participants.</p>

<p>One thing that has varied wildly across the 1000+ candidates I‚Äôve interviewed is what questions they ask when given time at the end of the session.</p>

<p>Asking good questions shows curiosity &amp; engagement, and it‚Äôs hard (as an interviewer) to determine how objectively significant or relevant it is when a candidate has good questions, or no questions. I find that the types of questions a candidate asks says a lot about what they care about. It‚Äôs difficult not to bias towards preferring candidates who ask good questions; which is unfair if we as interviewers are making it hard for candidates to feel comfortable asking what they want to ask.</p>

<p>When coaching interviewers, I‚Äôve settled on a few tactics to ensure that the candidate feels able to ask whatever they like. I know some interviewers make this intimidating, and ‚Äúdo you have any questions?‚Äù is one of the <em>least</em> inviting ways to ask this, especially to a nervous candidate.</p>

<p>I like to ask:</p>
<ul>
  <li>What do you want to know about (company)?</li>
  <li>What worries you about us, as a team or a business or a place to spend the next few years of your career?</li>
  <li>Is there anything you‚Äôd like to know that hasn‚Äôt been covered yet?</li>
</ul>

<p>These, in my experience, result in more questions from the candidate, and a more engaging conversation around their potential concerns.</p>

<p>Part of all this interviewing and interview design, from the company perspective, results in pulling together question banks to cover off certain interview criteria. And when I set out on my own job search recently, I found myself building interview kits for myself as candidate.</p>

<p>Here‚Äôs the generalised version of my interview question bank, specifically for candidates - the questions you should consider asking every interviewer you meet when changing role.</p>

<p>Some of these are the inverse of what I‚Äôve asked candidates for management roles; some I‚Äôve been asked and borrowed(!); some are questions I have used myself in ‚Äúnetworking‚Äù contexts.</p>

<h1 id="a-quick-note-on-research">A quick note on research</h1>

<p>Please don‚Äôt ask questions that you can look up online! I‚Äôd recommend looking at LinkedIn (the /people page in the company listing is super useful); Crunchbase; DueDil; AngelList; and of course the company blog &amp; about page.</p>

<p>Work out who‚Äôs interviewing you, look them up on LinkedIn to see if there‚Äôs anything particularly pertinent in their background that you‚Äôd like to ask about (e.g. maybe they changed teams while at the company). Slice up your questions so you can focus on asking the most relevant interviewer and therefore getting the most useful answers.</p>

<p>And finally, now you have a ton of things to ask, remember you‚Äôve probably only got 10 mins with each interviewer to find this stuff out - prioritise the things that matter most to you, not just the questions that make you think you sound smart.</p>
