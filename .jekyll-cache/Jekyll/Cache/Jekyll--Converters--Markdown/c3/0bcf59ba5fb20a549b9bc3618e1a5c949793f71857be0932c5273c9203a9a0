I"æ<p>I used to think I was conflict-averse - I get tense when people raise their voices, Iâ€™d do anything to avoid an argument, I hate feeling like Iâ€™m <em>wrong</em> or like someone else thinks Iâ€™m stupid.</p>

<p>Iâ€™m learning that being nice and agreeable isnâ€™t actually that useful when trying to achieve something difficult when multiple people are involved with and impacted by both the process and outcome.</p>

<p>Now, I find myself actively digging into conflict as soon as I sense it - because I hate wasting time, making under-informed decisions, and feeling awkwardly like someone disagrees but isnâ€™t sure how to.</p>

<h1 id="nice-vs-kind">nice vs kind</h1>

<p>Thereâ€™s a false dichotomy between being agreeable and having conflict. I want to explore this a bit: I think many people who are high-agreeability also engage in conflict from time to time.</p>

<p>For me, the root of this dichotomy sits with the word â€œniceâ€, and how we conflate that with being agreeable.</p>

<p>Nice is insipid, is easy, skirts around the difficult conversation. Nice needs to be perceived as likeable. Nice does whatâ€™s most palatable for everyone. Nice thrives on consensus and everybody agreeing and avoiding challenges.</p>

<p>Nice is not aspirational. I believe we should be aiming to be more <em>kind</em>, instead.</p>

<p>Think back to your last â€œI told you soâ€ moment:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Had you <em>actually</em> told the person so?</li>
  <li>Did you see it coming and imply that it might happen?</li>
  <li>Was there a reason why you couldnâ€™t help them avoid this?</li>
  <li>Are you here because you were being nice and polite?</li>
  <li>Or because you couldnâ€™t persuade them to mitigate this problem?</li>
</ul>

<p>Itâ€™s not kind to let someone run into an obstacle you foresee. Itâ€™s hard to be heard, and to persuade people to listen, especially if youâ€™re not in a position of power.</p>

<p>There are parallels here with the chatter about radical candour, where anecdotally this was applied in practice with people being rude under the guise of â€œjust being honestâ€. This is why kindness is so important to me.</p>

<p>As someone involved in many tough decisions that really impact peopleâ€™s lives - I am, after all, the face of firing people - I need to focus on doing this with kindness, more than doing the nice thing.</p>

<h1 id="does-it-have-to-be-personal">Does it have to be personal?</h1>

<p>So much of the time, people avoid conflict to preserve personal relationships. However Iâ€™m finding that being proactive in surfacing potential conflicts helps to build and strengthen interpersonal relationships (provided itâ€™s done with kindness!)</p>

<p>Little interpersonal frictions and tensions can be quashed easily when you surface the causes of conflicts and work to address them.</p>

<p>This breeds certainty in how the personal relationship stands, builds trust and respect, and makes it harder for personal resentment (due to misconstruing one anotherâ€™s position) to build up.</p>

<p>To do this takes a specific point of view: that conflict is not about squaring off against each other, but understanding the causes and putting them in front of both of you, and moving forward together to resolve them.</p>

<p>We need to start from the stance that weâ€™re both competent adults with similar amounts of context: if we disagree on what should happen next, then letâ€™s work out where the dissonance is coming from.</p>

<p>This becomes a togetherness exercise, focussed on finding common ground and misalignment on the following:</p>
<ul>
  <li>each personâ€™s understanding of the problem</li>
  <li>each personâ€™s criteria for success</li>
  <li>what we each value in a good solution</li>
  <li>the relative weight each person puts on each of these criteria &amp; values</li>
</ul>

<p>Once weâ€™ve done this, the way forward is often far more clear.</p>

<p>Then weâ€™re working together to understand each other, with a view to achieving the optimal solution. This stifles the interpersonal element of the conflict quite quickly, because youâ€™ve flipped the whole situation from â€˜we disagree on somethingâ€™ to â€˜letâ€™s work together on thisâ€™. Youâ€™re no longer dismissing or looking down on the other person, or persuading them that theyâ€™re wrong: youâ€™re inviting them in to help achieve a goal together.</p>

<h1 id="pre-empting-vs-preventing">Pre-empting, vs preventing</h1>

<p>Iâ€™m now trying to develop this approach to conflict resolution into a superpower - so I can elicit useful early feedback and get stuff done quicker with fewer meetings.</p>

<p>Part of this is because Iâ€™ve always had the CEO as my manager, who obviously never has time for quick check-ins - and partly because I hire my team to be proactive, focussed, intelligent creatives who need guidance and strategy more than instruction.</p>

<p>As ever this was iterative and developed over time; I started with aiming for <a href="https://42floors.com/blog/startups/thirty-percent-feedback">30% feedback</a> (four-minute read, I recommend it every month, it basically changed my professional life).</p>

<p>After that I realised that actually itâ€™s much easier to make â€œgoodâ€ decisions if you understand how the people around you think about decision-making. Like how you can score higher on a test if you understand the marking scheme.</p>

<p>The second version of this working process moved from â€œhey Iâ€™m 30% through this task, is it okâ€ to â€œhere is my plan, Iâ€™ll share a recommendation and two other options with you when I hit 30% of the way through so you can let me know what direction you preferâ€.</p>

<p>Then I realised you can shortcut even more of this by fronting up the conflict earlier:</p>
<ul>
  <li>hereâ€™s what I think the problem/challenge/task is</li>
  <li>here is what I want to achieve with a good solution</li>
  <li>of X Y &amp; Z I think Y is most important, Z is also necessary, X is a nice to have</li>
  <li>is there anything thatâ€™s important to you that Iâ€™m missing, or anything you think I havenâ€™t considered yet?</li>
</ul>

<p>This list of four steps makes everything sooooo much easier - no more running about doing unnecessary research; no more hearing frankly useless feedback like â€˜this isnâ€™t quite right but Iâ€™m not sure whyâ€™; no more spending time trying to optimise for something thatâ€™s not actually a priority; no more check-in meetings that couldâ€™ve been an FYI email.</p>

<p>Hopefully youâ€™re reading this thinking â€œok cool, conflict is maybe not only non-terrible but also could be useful?â€</p>

<p>Iâ€™d recommend trying this approach, and starting small. Try this framework for the next small project you pick up (whether itâ€™s work or not - I organised a friendâ€™s hen party this way and it worked super well).</p>

<p>Next time someone seems underwhelmed or like they think youâ€™re on the wrong track, set our your thinking on these lines and work out where you &amp; they disagree.</p>

<p>Once you know what the disagreement is (e.g. theyâ€™re optimising for cost; youâ€™re optimising for time; the other person thinks environmentally sustainable is the most important) it becomes so much easier to resolve.</p>

<p>Letâ€™s be kind, and letâ€™s welcome conflict in: things run quicker, with better outcomes, and less awkwardness.</p>

<p>Finally, a special shout-out of appreciation to all my delightful international colleagues over the years whoâ€™ve taught me the error of my English passive-aggressive ways..!</p>
