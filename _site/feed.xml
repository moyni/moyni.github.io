Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;jekyll serve&lt;/code&gt;, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To add new posts, simply add a file in the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;_posts&lt;/code&gt; directory that follows the convention &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext&lt;/code&gt; and includes the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-ruby&quot; data-lang=&quot;ruby&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;print_hi&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;puts&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;Hi, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;si&quot;&gt;#{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;si&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;print_hi&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'Tom'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;#=&amp;gt; prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

There were a few pieces of interesting feedback that were remarkably consistent across every person I interviewed with:
1. I have a different perspective / think about problems differently to them.
This has been a recurring theme in feedback from people I work with too (and friends!). 
2. It is unclear what how I approach my own personal development

I found this particularly interesting because I consider myself to be a curious person who spends a lot of time learning, and I really value the pursuit of learning - it's fun.

I concluded that I need to get better at articulating how I think about learning: particularly as a People leader, where I'll be responsible for helping everyone in the company learn and develop! So I’ve spent some time considering this and uncovered the empiric truth of how I approach learning. 

I found this exercise really helpful, so am sharing here both the way that I thought about this, and the conclusions I came to.

# Problem finding, problem solving

A couple of years ago I was fortunate enough to sneak into some of the talks at the exceptional Lead Developer conference in London. One really stuck with me - it hugely clarified something I'd been thinking about but hadn't developed a mental model for yet.

Please either pause and watch it:  or at least open it in a new tab and promise me you'll watch it later.

Fast forward to earlier this month, when I picked up Dan Pink's book To Sell Is Human. In one of the chapters, he pitches to his reader that the modern world of selling requires becoming a problem _finder_:

&quot;[Problem finders] sort through vast amounts of information and inputs, often from multiple disciplines; experiment with a variety of different approaches; are willing to switch directions in the course of a project; and often take longer than their counterparts to complete their work.&quot;

# Cooking

This brings me to this morning. I’m on my way to a knife skills course.

I really like food. I enjoy the creativity of making something delicious, and the gratification of spending time making a tangible thing then consuming it. There’s something around the instant feedback loop there too.

When I first moved out of my parents' house and became responsible for feeding myself, I concluded that I needed to become able to cook well.

A couple of caveats:
* I didn’t really learn to cook at home; my mum wasn’t super experimental, so taught me the basics but in a very intuitive way. 
* I find it hard to follow recipes - it limits my understanding of the WHY (&amp; reminds me of learning cookery at school where I spent about a year fucking up white sauce and pastry because I didn’t _get it_ enough to know what was important and how to fix mistakes)

So I set about achieving this goal of &quot;becoming able to cook well&quot; through various different strands - assembling the building blocks or grammar &amp; syntax of food.

Here's a list of the things I undertook, semi-deliberately, over the last 15(!!) years in order to become someone who can now cook well:
* sought out nice restaurants within my budget and ate things I didn't know how to cook
* read menus and collected themes of ingredients that people use together regularly
* started drinking my way through red wine and reading the labels to understand what I liked
* read a paper about soil, sun and climate change in relation to wine
* spent a few hours browsing in a book store to understand what combinations of foods cropped up in which geographic areas
* read more about climate, soil and local vegetables
* moved in with a man who has strong feelings about texture in food
* started trialling substitutions in my regular dishes to see what worked well (and what was actually disastrous or inedible)
* bought The Flavour Thesaurus by Nikki Segnit and read it cover to cover to cement the themes of flavour pairings
* watched my scientist sister cooking a roast dinner and how she thinks about heat
* had a baby and observed his approach to self-feeding
* read a series of papers about heat, which materials conduct, pre-heating, effect of moisture
* read The Omnivore’s Dilemma by Michael Pollan
* read the counterargument to this, Eating Animals by Jonathan Safran Foer
* sniffed a bunch of spices at a spice market on vacation
* took up origami (in the hope it would help me build the discipline of recipe-following!)
* watched Salt Fat Acid Heat on Netflix (twice)
* read a bunch of vegan blogs to get a better understanding of the politics of food
* read Sight Smell Touch Taste Sound by Sybil Kapoor
* signed up for a knife skills class
* bought (but haven't read yet!) Lateral Cooking, also by Nikki Segnit

Each of these things have help me build up a solid foundation on which I can build connections, understanding the history and politics and geography of food; cuisine, nutrition, balance; how the senses interplay in eating; the science behind how certain processes work.
Which had given me a super strong, well-informed approach to building meals that _just work_ and can be cooked free-hand (because while my origami game is strong I still rebel whenever I attempt to follow a recipe).

# Another, shorter example

I’ve taken a similar approach to art:

* hanging out in galleries
* learning where pigments come from
* studying aesthetics
* reading The Story of Art by EH Gombrich
* modelling for life drawing classes and listening intently
* reading some pop science articles to understand how humans perceive colour
* taking a course on contemporary art philosophy
* reading about the history of colour
* visiting more galleries &amp; exhibitions with engaged friends
* deliberately seeking out artists I love in curated exhibitions whose topics are unfamiliar
* taking up painting
* picking up some paint by numbers versions of famous paintings to understand how to paint nuanced colours &amp; shade (I freaking love the [Van-Go kits](https://faradayscienceshop.com/collections/van-go-paint-by-number-kits/))
* visiting yet more galleries....

Building a web of perspectives, drawing connections between them, identifying and honing in on the empty spaces and starting to sketch in what’s missing. 

# So what does this mean?

This connective dabbling, building a web of learning and perspective, is how learning through my career has worked too. Getting a deep understanding of analogous &amp; adjacent spaces and combining these in between from a slightly askew perspective to end up with something built from scratch, ground-up, without completely ignoring conventional wisdom.

I wonder how much of this is because I ended up studying philosophy for three years, and so dig deeply into epistemology, theory of knowledge and interlocking web-based models of truth and knowledge.

In the startup world, we have a huge opportunity to do things differently. We can reexamine existing models and fill out the gaps, we can dig deeper to find the problem that actually matters and build a solution that works for us.

In conventional business, if learning is a priority at all it's very linear. It's relatively easy to take a course that is obviously directly related to your role and will obviously directly impact your performance. But this isn't how everyone learns. I'd love to build a world where we make space for people to learn in this connective way. Where _of course_ your receptionist should take a user experience design course.

Because I think if I told most companies that to help me learn to cook I need a JSTOR subscription and a case of wine, they'd laugh. But here we are; so why not?</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">I decided to change jobs a couple of months ago, so spent a bunch of time interviewing and really learnt a lot about myself.</summary></entry></feed>
