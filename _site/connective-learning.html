    <p class="intro"><span class="dropcap">I</span> decided to change jobs a couple of months ago, so spent a bunch of time interviewing and really learnt a lot about myself.</p>

<p>There were a few pieces of interesting feedback that were remarkably consistent across every person I interviewed with:</p>
<ol>
  <li>I have a different perspective / think about problems differently to them.
This has been a recurring theme in feedback from people I work with too (and friends!).</li>
  <li>It is unclear what how I approach my own personal development</li>
</ol>

<p>I found this particularly interesting because I consider myself to be a curious person who spends a lot of time learning, and I really value the pursuit of learning - it’s fun.</p>

<p>I concluded that I need to get better at articulating how I think about learning: particularly as a People leader, where I’ll be responsible for helping everyone in the company learn and develop! So I’ve spent some time considering this and uncovered the empiric truth of how I approach learning.</p>

<p>I found this exercise really helpful, so am sharing here both the way that I thought about this, and the conclusions I came to.</p>

<h1 id="problem-finding-problem-solving">Problem finding, problem solving</h1>

<p>A couple of years ago I was fortunate enough to sneak into some of the talks at the exceptional Lead Developer conference in London. One really stuck with me - it hugely clarified something I’d been thinking about but hadn’t developed a mental model for yet.</p>

<p>Please either pause and watch it:  or at least open it in a new tab and promise me you’ll watch it later.</p>

<p>Fast forward to earlier this month, when I picked up Dan Pink’s book To Sell Is Human. In one of the chapters, he pitches to his reader that the modern world of selling requires becoming a problem <em>finder</em>:</p>

<p>“[Problem finders] sort through vast amounts of information and inputs, often from multiple disciplines; experiment with a variety of different approaches; are willing to switch directions in the course of a project; and often take longer than their counterparts to complete their work.”</p>

<h1 id="becoming-a-good-cook">Becoming a good cook</h1>

<p>This brings me to this morning. I’m on my way to a knife skills course.</p>

<p>I really like food. I enjoy the creativity of making something delicious, and the gratification of spending time making a tangible thing then consuming it. There’s something around the instant feedback loop there too.</p>

<p>When I first moved out of my parents’ house and became responsible for feeding myself, I concluded that I needed to become a good cook.</p>

<p>A couple of caveats:</p>
<ul>
  <li>I didn’t really learn to cook at home; my mum wasn’t super experimental, so taught me the basics but in a very intuitive way.</li>
  <li>I find it hard to follow recipes - it limits my understanding of the WHY (&amp; reminds me of learning cookery at school where I spent about a year fucking up white sauce and pastry because I didn’t <em>get it</em> enough to know what was important and how to fix mistakes)</li>
</ul>

<p>So I set about achieving this goal of <em>becoming a good cook</em> through various different strands - assembling the building blocks or grammar &amp; syntax of food.</p>

<p>Here’s a list of the things I undertook, semi-deliberately, over the last 15(!!) years in order to become someone who can now cook well:</p>
<ul>
  <li>sought out nice restaurants within my budget and ate things I didn’t know how to cook</li>
  <li>read menus and collected themes of ingredients that people use together regularly</li>
  <li>started drinking my way through red wine and reading the labels to understand what I liked</li>
  <li>read a paper about soil, sun and climate change in relation to wine</li>
  <li>spent a few hours browsing in a book store to understand what combinations of foods cropped up in which geographic areas</li>
  <li>read more about climate, soil and local vegetables</li>
  <li>moved in with a man who has strong feelings about texture in food</li>
  <li>started trialling substitutions in my regular dishes to see what worked well (and what was actually disastrous or inedible)</li>
  <li>bought The Flavour Thesaurus by Nikki Segnit and read it cover to cover to cement the themes of flavour pairings</li>
  <li>watched my scientist sister cooking a roast dinner and how she thinks about heat</li>
  <li>had a baby and observed his approach to self-feeding</li>
  <li>read a series of papers about heat, which materials conduct, pre-heating, effect of moisture</li>
  <li>read The Omnivore’s Dilemma by Michael Pollan</li>
  <li>read the counterargument to this, Eating Animals by Jonathan Safran Foer</li>
  <li>sniffed a bunch of spices at a spice market on vacation</li>
  <li>took up origami (in the hope it would help me build the discipline of recipe-following!)</li>
  <li>watched Salt Fat Acid Heat on Netflix (twice)</li>
  <li>read a bunch of vegan blogs to get a better understanding of the politics of food</li>
  <li>read Sight Smell Touch Taste Sound by Sybil Kapoor</li>
  <li>signed up for a knife skills class</li>
  <li>bought (but haven’t read yet!) Lateral Cooking, also by Nikki Segnit</li>
</ul>

<p>Each of these things have help me build up a solid foundation on which I can build connections, understanding the history and politics and geography of food; cuisine, nutrition, balance; how the senses interplay in eating; the science behind how certain processes work.
Which had given me a super strong, well-informed approach to building meals that <em>just work</em> and can be cooked free-hand (because while my origami game is strong I still rebel whenever I attempt to follow a recipe).</p>

<h1 id="another-shorter-example">Another, shorter example</h1>

<p>I’ve taken a similar approach to art:</p>

<ul>
  <li>hanging out in galleries</li>
  <li>learning where pigments come from</li>
  <li>studying aesthetics</li>
  <li>reading The Story of Art by EH Gombrich</li>
  <li>modelling for life drawing classes and listening intently</li>
  <li>reading some pop science articles to understand how humans perceive colour</li>
  <li>taking a course on contemporary art philosophy</li>
  <li>reading about the history of colour</li>
  <li>visiting more galleries &amp; exhibitions with engaged friends</li>
  <li>deliberately seeking out artists I love in curated exhibitions whose topics are unfamiliar</li>
  <li>taking up painting</li>
  <li>picking up some paint by numbers versions of famous paintings to understand how to paint nuanced colours &amp; shade (I freaking love the <a href="https://faradayscienceshop.com/collections/van-go-paint-by-number-kits/">Van-Go kits</a>)</li>
  <li>visiting yet more galleries….</li>
</ul>

<p>Building a web of perspectives, drawing connections between them, identifying and honing in on the empty spaces and starting to sketch in what’s missing.</p>

<h1 id="so-what-does-this-mean">So what does this mean?</h1>

<p>This connective dabbling, building a web of learning and perspective, is how learning through my career has worked too. Getting a deep understanding of analogous &amp; adjacent spaces and combining these in between from a slightly askew perspective to end up with something built from scratch, ground-up, without completely ignoring conventional wisdom.</p>

<p>I wonder how much of this is because I ended up studying philosophy for three years, and so dig deeply into epistemology, theory of knowledge and interlocking web-based models of truth and knowledge.</p>

<p>In the startup world, we have a huge opportunity to do things differently. We can reexamine existing models and fill out the gaps, we can dig deeper to find the problem that actually matters and build a solution that works for us.</p>

<p>In conventional business, if learning is a priority at all it’s very linear. It’s relatively easy to take a course that is obviously directly related to your role and will obviously directly impact your performance. But this isn’t how everyone learns. I’d love to build a world where we make space for people to learn in this connective way. Where <em>of course</em> your receptionist should take a user experience design course.</p>

<p>Because I think if I told most companies that to help me learn to cook I need a JSTOR subscription and a case of wine, they’d laugh. But here we are; so why not?</p>
