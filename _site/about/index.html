<p>Hi, I’m Maria Campbell.</p>

<p>I’ve spent my career building high potential startups into fast-growing successful companies that people love to work at.</p>

<p>Over that time I’ve learnt a huge amount about people, culture, communication, hiring, and the tech startup ecosystem. I’ll share some of what I’ve learnt here.</p>

<p>I’m also available for consulting from time to time! Get in touch if you’d like to work with me.</p>
