Hi, I'm Maria Campbell. 

I've spent my career building high potential startups into fast-growing successful companies that people love to work at.

Over that time I've learnt a huge amount about people, culture, communication, hiring, and the tech startup ecosystem. I'll share some of what I've learnt here. 

I'm also available for consulting from time to time! Get in touch if you'd like to work with me.
