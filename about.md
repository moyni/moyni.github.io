Hi, I'm Maria Campbell.

I've spent my career building high potential startups into fast-growing successful companies that people love to work at.

Over that time I've learnt a huge amount about people, culture, communication, hiring, and the tech startup ecosystem. I'll share some of what I've learnt here. 

I'm also available for public speaking, and I do consulting from time to time! <a href="/contact/">Get in touch</a> if you'd like to work with me.
